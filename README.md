# The Odin Project | Rock Paper Scissor (RPS)

What I Learned :
- Changing various DOM
- Before it has UI which is still using prompts, it can get very unexpected maybe because of the prompts behaviour 

Notes for this project :
- Not responsive yet
- The UI can still be improved a lot, by using modal,timeInterval,timeOut, gif when the game end
